# FLASHFORGE-5M-PRO-CURA-START-END-GCODE

STABLE BETA FLASHFORGE 5M PRO CURA START/END GCODE 

(Still working on fine tuning the gcode to remove any unnecessary code/movements. You will need to change the M140 S50, M104 T0 S210 to whatever bed temp and nozzle temp you have on the cura settings. For some reason leaving this at the S0 default temp doesnt grab onto the slicer's default temp settings like it should. I have my bed at 50 and my nozzle at 210. The reason for this was to add the purge line that I get with the flashprint slicer. I dont like the FF slicer other than the camera setting)
